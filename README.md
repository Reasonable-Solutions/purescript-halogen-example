Work in progress. Still to do:
- State API for application-wide state
- Ajax API for abstracting requests
- ShowDialog API as a way to pass our monad as "actions"
- lots of comments in these files, clean them up a bit as well
- some sort of overview in this file

Sample Halogen app with a few DSLs implemented as the application's free monad.
